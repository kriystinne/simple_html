simple html task to get started with the basics

This is an attempt to get into the rythm of designing simple html pages withot Bootstrap. Basically identifying each element and adding styles as per the instructions in the comments.

The basic idea was **not** to get a super nice looking site, but rather to make sure I understand how each "box" and item is styled and positioned.
